# Breakage Radar for Home Assistant

**Which of my custom integrations stop working, and in which Home Assistant release?**

Home Assistant announces API removals a year ahead on the developer blog and marks
them in code with `breaks_in_ha_version=`. Core integrations get migrated. Custom
integrations mostly do not — and the author of the integration you installed from HACS
two years ago may not be reading the developer blog at all.

Worse, the warning never reaches *you*. In `homeassistant/helpers/frame.py`:

```python
def report_usage(
    what: str,
    *,
    breaks_in_ha_version: str | None = None,
    core_behavior: ReportBehavior = ReportBehavior.ERROR,
    core_integration_behavior: ReportBehavior = ReportBehavior.LOG,
    custom_integration_behavior: ReportBehavior = ReportBehavior.LOG,
    ...
) -> None:
```

`custom_integration_behavior` defaults to **LOG**. A custom integration that uses a
doomed API gets one line in `home-assistant.log` — while it still works. On upgrade
day it simply stops. And Repairs deliberately will not carry the warning; from the
architecture discussion that approved the legacy device tracker removal
([#1375](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/discussions/1375)):

> "Repairs must be user actionable, and in this case, they can't solve it." — Frenck

Breakage Radar closes that gap. It reads the removals out of Home Assistant's own
source, crawls every custom integration in the HACS catalogue for them, publishes the
result as a public index, and ships a Home Assistant integration that tells you which
of **your** installed integrations are on the list and when they die.

📊 **Board:** <https://booyaka101.github.io/hass-breakage-radar/> — what breaks
*when*: anything already past its release date first, then what breaks within
90 days, with everything later collapsed below. Every release heading carries
its estimated date ("Home Assistant 2026.10 - 7 October 2026 - in 46 days",
first Wednesday of the month per Home Assistant's published schedule).
🤖 **Index:** <https://booyaka101.github.io/hass-breakage-radar/index.json> (schema 1,
with `release_date` and `days_until` on every entry and release)
📡 **Feed:** <https://booyaka101.github.io/hass-breakage-radar/feed.xml> — one item per
Home Assistant release, carrying what that release removes and which integrations still
use it, so you can follow along without polling the index. Paste it into a feed reader,
or into Home Assistant's own `feedreader` integration; open it in a browser and it
renders as a page.

**In the published index right now:** all 4 009 HACS repositories crawled
(3 244 integrations and 765 Lovelace plugins, 19 unreachable), **922 affected**,
**2 504 findings**, across 8 Home Assistant releases: 11 in 2026.10, 96 in 2026.11,
11 in 2027.5, 51 in 2027.6, 28 in 2027.7, 735 in 2027.8, 142 in 2027.9 and 1 in 2027.10
(counted by distinct integration domain). 63 of the 123 announced removals have a
matcher behind them; the board says so on itself, and the other 60 are carried for
their deadline only. Three markers are refused as too vague to match, which the board
also states: `InfraredEntity`, a class name too short to match on its own, and the two
English words the extractor used to mistake for keyword names; a short name pinned to
its module or scoped to its entity base class is matched anyway. Every number comes
from a real crawl; nothing is seeded or simulated.
The daily job keeps these moving, and `coverage` in `index.json` is always authoritative.

## How this differs from Spook, and from reading the log

Two questions come up every time this gets posted, so they belong here rather than in
a comment thread.

**Spook** inspects the instance you are running and reports what is wrong with it
*now*: entities an automation references that no longer exist, action calls that point
at nothing, orphaned entities an integration left behind, YAML it cannot parse.
It surfaces those through Repairs and will often fix them for you. It does not read the
source of your custom integrations, and it has no opinion about a core API that works
perfectly today and is deleted in 2027.8. That second thing is the only thing Breakage
Radar looks at, so the two barely touch. Run both. If Spook has since grown a check that
overlaps, open an issue and this paragraph gets corrected.

**The log** is the closer call, and it is a real answer. Home Assistant calls
`report_usage()` when deprecated code actually runs, and for a custom integration that
lands in `home-assistant.log` naming the release that removes it. Grep your log and you
will catch a lot of this.

What a log cannot report is a call that did not happen. A deprecated call inside an
error handler, or behind a config option you never set, stays silent until the day it
fires, which may well be the upgrade that removes it. A log also cannot tell you about
an integration you have not installed yet, and it cannot help an author check their own
repository without a running instance. Static analysis reads every branch of the source,
covers the whole HACS catalogue, and runs in a checkout.

Where the log wins is precision, and that is worth saying plainly: it observed the call,
so there is nothing to argue about, while a finding here is a static match and can be
wrong. [#25](https://github.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/issues/25) tracks running
a real log against the rule set as an answer key, in both directions.

## Two halves in one repository

| | What it is | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| **A. The crawler** | `tools/` — extracts rules from Home Assistant core, fetches the HACS integration **and plugin** catalogues, scans each repository's `custom_components/**/*.py` and card JavaScript, publishes `docs/index.json` + a static board | GitHub Actions, daily |
| **B. The integration** | `custom_components/breakage_radar/` — downloads the index every 12 h, matches it against what is installed, **runs the same matchers over your own installed source and cards**, exposes one sensor and raises a repairs issue | Your Home Assistant box |

No server, no account, no API key, no third-party runtime dependency. The integration's
`manifest.json` declares `"requirements": []`.

Inside `custom_components/breakage_radar/`, one job per module:

| Module | Job |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py`, `config_flow.py`, `const.py` | standard Home Assistant wiring |
| `coordinator.py` | fetch the index, drive the scan off the event loop, cache it |
| `discovery.py` | what is installed (`{domain: version}` from each `manifest.json`) |
| `scanner.py` | run the matchers over installed source; count what it could not read |
| `report.py` | decide what index + local scan add up to, and at which level |
| `repairs.py`, `sensor.py` | how that surfaces in Home Assistant |
| `rules_engine.py` | the AST matchers, vendored byte-for-byte from `tools/` |
| `schedule.py` | release label → estimated date, vendored the same way |

`discovery.py`, `scanner.py` and `report.py` import no `homeassistant` symbols at all,
which is why the exact code that runs on your box is unit-tested without a Home
Assistant install.

## Install (Home Assistant side)

### Via HACS (custom repository)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Booyaka101&repository=hass-breakage-radar&category=integration)

Or by hand:

1. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories**
2. URL `https://github.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar`, category **Integration**
3. Install **Breakage Radar**, restart Home Assistant
4. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Breakage Radar** → Submit

### Manually

Copy `custom_components/breakage_radar/` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/`
directory and restart, then add the integration from the UI.

The config flow has a single confirmation step. Two settings are available afterwards
under **Configure**: how far ahead a deadline gets its own notification, and any
integrations you want left out of the report entirely.

### What you get

`sensor.breakage_radar_affected` — the number of installed custom integrations with at
least one finding. The full report, including every message and link, is one click away
under **Download diagnostics** on the integration's page.

Findings come from two sources, and every `findings` entry says which:

* `source: local` — the integration parsed the **installed bytes** in your own
  `custom_components/` directory with the same ten AST matchers the crawler
  uses. Forks, renamed copies and integrations installed outside HACS get a real
  verdict this way, and there is no version skew: the scanned version *is* the
  installed version.
* `source: index` — the published index's verdict, used where the local scan
  could not reach one (for example a file over the size caps).

```yaml
state: 2
attributes:
  schedule:
    - release: "2027.5"
      due: "May 2027, about 9 months away"
      when: imminent
      domains: [some_tracker]
      count: 1
  findings:
    - domain: some_tracker
      rule_id: legacy-device-tracker-platform
      breaks_in: "2027.5"
      file: custom_components/some_tracker/device_tracker.py
      line: 12
      confidence: high
      source: local
      when: imminent        # broken_now | imminent | upcoming
      days_until: 21
  index_generated_utc: "2026-08-11T03:57:51Z"
  affected_domains: [some_tracker, another_integration]
  broken_now: {}
  broken_now_count: 0
  imminent:
    some_tracker: {release: "2027.5", days: 21}
  imminent_count: 1
  alert_window_days: 30
  not_analysed: [broken_thing]
  clean_count: 4
  files_scanned: 412
  unparsed_files: 1
  skipped_files: 0
  earliest_release: "2027.5"
  total_findings: 5
```

A domain that is nowhere in the index but parses clean locally lands in
the clean count; only a domain **neither** side could analyse stays in
`not_analysed`. `files_scanned`, `unparsed_files` and
`skipped_files` make a truncated scan visible — it is never silently reported
as clean. The scan runs in an executor and is cached on each integration's file
count, newest mtime, total size and the rules fingerprint, so the 12-hourly
refresh re-parses nothing that has not changed.

### Three levels, so a year-out deadline is not shouted at you

Every finding is sorted by how soon it bites, and that decides how loudly it appears:

| Level | When | What you see |
|---|---|---|
| `broken_now` | your running Home Assistant already reached the deadline | one **ERROR** Repairs issue per integration |
| `imminent` | the release is due inside the alert window (30 days by default) | one **WARNING** Repairs issue per integration, up to five |
| `upcoming` | further out | **one** summary issue listing what breaks in each release |

The summary tells you which integration breaks when, not just how many:

```
2026.10 - October 2026, about 2 months away: argoclima, miele, thermia
2026.11 - November 2026, about 3 months away: bosch, octopus_energy, spook
2027.8  - August 2027, about a year away: yandex_station
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/main/images/repairs-list.png"
       alt="The Home Assistant repairs panel showing one notification per imminent integration plus a single summary"
       width="760">
</p>

Each per-integration notification links to that integration's releases page and to a
search for an existing report of the same deprecation, so you can add a reaction
instead of filing a duplicate:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/main/images/integration-notification.png"
       alt="A notification for a single integration, linking to its releases, to existing reports and to the Home Assistant change"
       width="760">
</p>

Change the window under **Settings → Devices & Services → Breakage Radar →
Configure**: 30, 60 or 90 days, 6 months or a year. It applies immediately. However
wide the window, at most five notifications are raised at once, since the summary
lists every date anyway.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/main/images/options.png" alt="The options dialog, choosing how far ahead to be alerted" width="760">
</p>

The same dialog takes a list of integrations to leave out. It offers whatever is
currently reported on your system, and anything you pick stops producing findings,
notifications and counts altogether. Nothing is ever excluded on your behalf: the
list starts empty, including for HACS itself, which is affected like anything else.

The point of the split is that Repairs has no snooze button. A dozen cards for
deadlines a year away would only teach you to ignore the panel — which is where every
*other* integration raises things you genuinely must act on. So distant deadlines stay
grouped and summarised, and a card only appears when there is something to do this
month: update the integration, replace it, or raise it upstream while the maintainer
still has time.

Home Assistant [releases on the first Wednesday of every
month](https://www.home-assistant.io/faq/release/), so a release label maps to an exact
expected date — the rule matches all eight 2026 releases to the day, and a test pins
that. It is computed rather than fetched, so a one-off rescheduled release would shift
it; `broken_now` never relies on it either way — it is decided by comparing your
running version to the deadline. Upgrading past a
deadline makes a finding *more* visible, never less.

Each issue links to the board and clears itself — when an updated version no longer
contains the removed API, when the integration is uninstalled, or when a deadline
stops being imminent. None of them are fixable in place: the code lives in someone
else's repository.

Automate on it:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Warn me about doomed custom integrations
    triggers:
      - trigger: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.breakage_radar_affected
        above: 0
    actions:
      - action: notify.persistent_notification
        data:
          title: "{{ states('sensor.breakage_radar_affected') }} integrations will break"
          message: >-
            First deadline: Home Assistant
            {{ state_attr('sensor.breakage_radar_affected', 'earliest_release') }}.
            {{ state_attr('sensor.breakage_radar_affected', 'affected_domains') | join(', ') }}
```

## Run the crawler yourself

Python 3.12+ (3.14 strongly recommended — see *Which Python* below). No dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar
cd hass-breakage-radar

python tools/extract_rules.py     # -> data/rules.json      (from HA core source)
python tools/blog_rules.py        # -> merges blog + data/manual_rules.json
python tools/catalog.py           # -> data/catalog.json    (every HACS integration)
python tools/scan.py --limit 400  # -> data/findings.json + state/crawl.json
python tools/build_index.py       # -> docs/index.json + docs/index.html
```

Run them in that order. `extract_rules.py` **rewrites** `data/rules.json` from core alone,
so `blog_rules.py` must follow it to merge the hand-curated and prose rules back in.
The GitHub Actions workflow does exactly this.

Whether a rule is still *pending* is decided against the latest **released** core
version, not the dev branch the rules are read from. Dev bumps to N+1 as soon as
the N branch is cut, about two weeks before N ships, so during an RC window dev is
two releases ahead of what anybody runs, and comparing against it would retire
the RC release's rules in exactly the week a user can still act
([#46](https://github.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/issues/46)). The released
version comes from PyPI (`info.version` of the `homeassistant` package), cached on
disk for six hours. When that lookup fails or the run is offline, the last release
PyPI did report is reused, and with nothing remembered at all the floor becomes dev
minus one. Both can only keep a just-shipped release listed a little longer, never
hide an unshipped one, and both say so in the run's output. Holding the remembered
value also keeps a failed request from moving `rules_hash` and queuing a
catalogue-wide rescan that would reverse itself the next day.

The same response lists every version PyPI holds, so a `2026.9.0b1` sitting
alongside a newest release of `2026.8.3` says 2026.9 is in its release
candidate period. The board shows that as its own tile and `index.json`
publishes it as `rc_release`, next to the `pending_floor` and
`pending_floor_source` the filters actually used. That is the window worth
acting in: the removals in an RC release land within days, not months.

Real output from `tools/extract_rules.py` on this machine:

```
INFO breakage_radar.tools: core version in tarball: 2026.9 (sha256 3b8456c44b40)
INFO breakage_radar.tools: scanned 9865 core files, 145 deprecation call sites

```

Real output from `tools/scan.py` and `tools/build_index.py`. This is the v1.0.0 crawl
slice, kept as a worked example of what a run prints — the published index has since
been widened by the daily job, so its totals are larger (see the figures at the top):

```
INFO breakage_radar.tools: 32 matchable rules (core 2026.9, rules_hash 0708f404a48c72d3)

INFO breakage_radar.tools:   legacy-device-tracker-platform                   6 repo(s)    0.5%
```

Real finds from that crawl, each hand-verified against the repository's own source:

| Integration | Breaks in | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `XiaoMi/ha_xiaomi_home` (22 k ★) | 2027.7 | `battery_level` and `location_name` properties on a device tracker entity |
| `WulfgarW/homeassistant-pycupra` | 2027.5 | module-level `async_setup_scanner` in `device_tracker.py` |
| `PaulAnnekov/home-assistant-padavan-tracker` | 2027.5 | `get_scanner` **and** a `DeviceScanner` subclass |
| `404GamerNotFound/vserver-ssh-stats` | 2027.8 | `async_update_device(remove_config_entry_id=…)` and `DeviceInfo(via_device=…)` |

`state/crawl.json` remembers what was scanned at which version, so the next run only
revisits repositories that actually changed. `--limit` caps a run; least-recently-scanned
repositories go first, so coverage rotates on its own.

A slice is almost entirely waiting on the network: the 1.12.0 rescan measured under ten
percent CPU. Tarballs are therefore downloaded `--workers` at a time, ahead of the scan,
and every tag tarball is kept under `.cache/tarballs/` once fetched. A tag never moves,
so a cached one is right for as long as the catalogue points at it, and a rules or engine
change that requeues the whole catalogue becomes a local job of minutes rather than a
day of downloads. The whole catalogue is about 2.4 GB on disk, and branches are never
cached. CI passes `--no-tarball-cache`, because a
fresh runner would spend longer uploading the cache than it saved.

### The crawl conflicts with open pull requests, and that hides checks

The crawl commits `data/rules.json`, `docs/` and `state/` daily. A branch that touches
any of them conflicts within hours, and **GitHub cannot build `refs/pull/N/merge` for a
conflicted pull request, so it skips that pull request's checks entirely.** They do not
fail, they never run, and the page shows no checks rather than a red one. It reads like a
branch nobody pushed to.

Two things address it, because the cause cannot be removed entirely:

* `tools/rules_changed.py` keeps `data/rules.json` out of the commit when only its
  provenance stamps moved, which was the commonest trigger.
* `tools/pr_health.py`, run daily by `.github/workflows/pr-health.yml` just after the
  crawl, labels any open pull request GitHub reports as `CONFLICTING` and explains once
  what the missing checks mean. It runs from the default branch, because a workflow
  inside a skipped pull request cannot report on itself. `UNKNOWN` mergeability is left
  alone rather than guessed at, in either direction.

If a board PR conflicts, take `main`'s crawl output and regenerate rather than resolving
`docs/index.json` by hand:

```bash
git rebase origin/main
git checkout origin/main -- docs/index.json docs/index.html docs/feed.xml
python tools/build_index.py
```

### Which Python

Home Assistant's `dev` branch tracks the newest CPython syntax. As of core 2026.9 dev
it uses PEP 758 unparenthesized `except A, B:`, which needs **Python 3.14**. Measured
on the same tarball:

| Interpreter | Core files that fail to parse | Deprecation call sites found |
|---|---|---|
| 3.11 | 23 | 98 |
| 3.12 | 11 | 115 |
| **3.14** | **0** | **145** |

Running on an older interpreter silently loses rules from `device_registry.py`,
`device_tracker/legacy.py`, `trigger.py` and `config_entries.py`. The extractor never
hides this: `rules.json` records `extractor_python`, `counts.core_files_unparsed` and
the full `unparsed_core_files` list, and logs a warning. The GitHub Actions workflow
pins 3.14.

---

## How rules are chosen

There are three sources, and they are not equally trusted.

**1. Extracted from core (`origin: core-ast`).** Every call in `homeassistant/**/*.py`
that passes a string literal to `breaks_in_ha_version`. The message is then turned into
a matcher only when it names something specific enough:

* `"calls async_device_info_to_link_from_entity, which is deprecated…"` → a `call`
  matcher, pinned to the module that defines it.
* `"doesn't specify unit_class when calling async_import_statistics"` → read off
  the `if` the marker sits under, not off the sentence. `if "unit_class" not in
  metadata` is a key of the `metadata` argument, so it becomes a
  `call_missing_arg_key` matcher; `if new_unit_of_measurement is not UNDEFINED and
  new_unit_class is UNDEFINED` is a real keyword, and the first half of it becomes
  `requires`. The prose cannot tell those apart, and reading it as a keyword is what
  shipped 99 wrong findings in 1.11.0: `unit_class=` is not a keyword
  `async_import_statistics` accepts at all, so the matcher fired on every caller,
  correct ones included. The enclosing `def` is also the target, because core's
  `mean_type` marker inside `async_add_external_statistics` names
  `async_import_statistics`. A guard neither shape fits is published as prose and
  recorded in `discarded_markers` as `unreadable_guard`.
* `"calls `async_listen` which is deprecated"` → a `call` matcher pinned to
  `homeassistant.components.labs.helpers`. `async_listen` is 12 characters and everybody
  has one, so the pin is what makes it a rule: the engine only fires where the file's
  imports prove the call reaches that module, and `self.async_listen(...)` or
  `from .bus import async_listen` never do.
* a marker on a property of a Home Assistant entity base class → an `attr` matcher
  **scoped to that class**. The 2026.9 removal of vacuum `battery_level` reads as
  `{"type": "attr", "names": ["battery_level"], "in_class_base": ["StateVacuumEntity"]}`,
  so a class deriving from `StateVacuumEntity` is a finding and `class Foo:
  battery_level = 50` is not.

A *bare* auto-derived symbol must still be at least 18 characters and survive a denylist,
because on its own it would match everybody's own helper of the same name. Bare means
neither pinned to the core module that defines it nor scoped to the class it is
deprecated on; in both cases what identifies the deprecation is the pair, not the word,
and the length gate does not apply. Since every `call` matcher carries its module, the
gate is left with deprecated class names, which have no such proof. Everything else is
published for the board but never claims a repository is affected, and the count of
markers dropped that way is on the board, in `counts.markers_discarded`, and in what
`tools/check_local.py` prints before its verdict.

Scoping only fires for classes integrations are meant to subclass, which Home Assistant
names `<Domain>Entity`. A deprecation on `ConfigFlow` or `DeviceRegistry` gets no scoped
rule: nobody overrides those, so the rule would never match anything. That is a
deliberate undercount.

A keyword the prose supplies gets the same treatment. Core writes *"calls
`async_get_or_create` with a `via_device` referencing the device itself"*, and reading
"calls X with Y" off that sentence yields the keyword `a`. Until 1.12.0 two such rules
shipped matchable and could never fire. A derived keyword now has to be plausible as a
Python one: never a stopword, and if it is under four characters or carries no
underscore it has to appear verbatim as a parameter name somewhere in the same core
file. Rejected markers are published as prose and counted in
`counts.markers_discarded`, so the gap is a number rather than a silence.

The same pass also reads core's *other* removal mechanism, which has nothing to do with
`report_usage`. A module declares
`_DEPRECATED_TrackerEntity = DeprecatedAlias(_TrackerEntity, "homeassistant.components.device_tracker.TrackerEntity", "2027.6")`
and hands its `__getattr__` to `check_if_deprecated_constant`, so the warning fires on
the *import*. Those become `import_from` rules at `high` confidence: a named import from
an exact module has no receiver to infer, so the 18-character gate does not apply. They
are keyed on the deprecating module, never the symbol alone, because the same name
imported from the replacement path is the fix rather than the problem.

**2. Hand-curated (`origin: manual`, `data/manual_rules.json`).** Removals announced in
prose with no `report_usage` call behind them — the legacy device tracker platform API,
the device registry single-config-entry changes, the device tracker property removals.
Each one quotes its source post.

Core sometimes carries a marker for the same removal whose message is prose the
extractor cannot turn into a matcher. A hand-written rule can name those ids in
`supersedes`, and the merge drops them: two board entries for one deprecation, one of
them with no matcher and no advice, reads as two problems.

**3. Blog prose (`origin: blog`).** Every removal sentence found on
<https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/>, published as `matchable: false` so the
board shows the deadline even when no static check exists.

### Why matching resolves imports

A rule written from a spec is a hypothesis, and this one was wrong on the first crawl
slice. `entity_registry.async_generate_entity_id` is removed in 2027.2;
`entity.async_generate_entity_id` is fine. They share a name. A naive matcher flagged
`0xAlon/dolphin`, which imports the healthy one.

So every `call` matcher can be pinned to a module, and the engine builds an import map
before it fires:

```python
from homeassistant.helpers.entity import async_generate_entity_id           # no finding
from homeassistant.helpers.entity_registry import async_generate_entity_id  # finding
from homeassistant.helpers import entity_registry as er                     # finding
from .my_own_registry import async_get_device                               # no finding
```

Where the receiver is only known at runtime — `registry.async_get_device(...)` — the
import graph cannot prove anything, so those rules opt in explicitly with
`allow_unresolved_attribute` and are published at `confidence: medium`.

`docs/index.json` publishes every rule's measured `repos_hit`, so a rule that fires on
an implausible fraction of the catalogue is visible rather than quietly taxing everyone.

### Matcher types

| Type | Fires on |
|---|---|
| `moduledef` | a module-level `def`/`async def` with one of `names` |
| `classbase` | a `class` deriving from one of `bases` |
| `attr` | a property or `_attr_` assignment named in `names` |
| `attr_access` | reading `something.<name>` |
| `attr_access_typed` | reading `something.<name>` where the receiver is first proved, by single-file inference, to come from the helper module the matcher names — built for `DeviceEntry.config_entries`, whose name collides with `hass.config_entries` |
| `container_use` | a *deprecated use* of a container attribute on a proved registry: subscription, a lookup method, or membership by device id on `registry.devices`. Iterating the very same attribute stays supported |
| `call` | a call to one of `names` |
| `call_kwarg` | a call to one of `names` passing any keyword in `kwargs` |
| `call_missing_kwarg` | a call to one of `names` *not* passing `kwarg`, and passing every keyword in `requires` if there is one — core arms some of these checks only when a related keyword is present |
| `call_missing_arg_key` | a call to one of `names` whose mapping argument (`arg`, `arg_index`) provably does not set `key`. For options core takes inside a `TypedDict` argument rather than as keywords: a dict literal, a `constructors` call, or a local or module-level name that resolves to one. A mapping the file cannot read in full — spread from `**`, built by a helper, mutated through `update()`, handed in as a parameter — is never a finding |
| `call_hass_argument` | a call to one of `names` that passes `hass` — for `@deprecated_hass_argument`, where the *argument* is deprecated, not the function |
| `import_from` | `from <module in modules> import <name in names>` — for core's other removal mechanism, `_DEPRECATED_X = DeprecatedAlias(...)` behind a module `__getattr__`, where the import itself is what breaks. The module is the whole rule: the same name imported from the replacement path is the fix |
| `js` | an anchored `token` in `.js`/`.ts`/`.mjs` source, comments stripped, only in files that reference the WebSocket API. Built for the device registry WebSocket deprecations, which break Lovelace cards rather than Python integrations |

Any matcher can be narrowed with `files` (exact basenames); `attr` matchers can also
require `in_class_base`.

`attr_access_typed` and `container_use` need to know what counts as proof, so they
carry the helper module they trust rather than hard-coding one. Both walk the same
scope inference. The keys, as used by `device-entry-config-entries` and
`device-registry-devices-mapping` in `data/manual_rules.json`:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `module` | the helper module every proof below has to resolve to |
| `registry_factory` | function returning the registry, e.g. `async_get` for `dr.async_get(hass)` |
| `registry_types` | type names that prove a registry when used as an annotation |
| `entry_types` | type names that prove an entry when used as an annotation |
| `entry_methods` | registry methods returning an entry, called on a proved receiver |
| `entry_containers` | mappings on a proved registry whose values are entries, e.g. `devices` |
| `entry_functions` | module-level functions returning entries, resolved through the import map |
| `entry_params` | `{function name: 1-based parameter}` typed by a platform contract rather than by an annotation |
| `container` | (`container_use`) the attribute on the registry the rule is about, e.g. `devices` |
| `uses` | (`container_use`) which uses of it break: `subscript`, `method`, `membership`, or `any` for an attribute deprecated outright |
| `methods` | (`container_use`) the lookup methods that count, e.g. `get`, `values`, `keys` |

Names are proved per scope, nested scopes inherit their enclosing one, and a registry
assigned to an attribute (`self._registry = dr.async_get(hass)`) is proved for the
whole class, since that assignment usually lives in `__init__` and the lookups do not.

`container_use` exists because `registry.devices` is not deprecated. Using it as a
mapping is. Core's replacement is a view whose `__getitem__`, `__contains__` and
`__getattr__` report, while `__iter__` and `__len__` do not, so `reg.devices[device_id]`
and `reg.devices.get(x)` break in 2027.9 while `for device in reg.devices` and
`len(reg.devices)` do not. Membership fires only where the left operand reads like a
device id, meaning a string literal or a name ending `_id`, because core reports string
membership only, and `device_entry in reg.devices` is the supported form.

The engine lives in `tools/rules_engine.py` and is vendored byte-for-byte at
`custom_components/breakage_radar/rules_engine.py`, so the crawler and the
integration's local scan can never disagree about the same source — a test
asserts the two copies are identical.

## The worked example

A custom integration on the legacy device tracker platform API:

```python
# custom_components/fixture_tracker/device_tracker.py
"""Fixture: a custom integration still on the legacy device tracker platform API.

A module-level ``setup_scanner`` in a file named ``device_tracker.py`` is the
legacy platform entry point Home Assistant removes in the 2027.5 release.
"""

from homeassistant.const import CONF_HOST

DOMAIN = "fixture_tracker"


def setup_scanner(hass, config, see, discovery_info=None):   # <- line 12
    ...
```

produces **exactly one** finding:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "legacy-device-tracker-platform",
  "breaks_in": "2027.5",
  "file": "custom_components/fixture_tracker/device_tracker.py",
  "line": 12,
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

and with it installed the sensor reads `1` with
`schedule[0] == {release: "2027.5", domains: ["fixture_tracker"], ...}`.

Lookalikes produce **zero** findings — `setup_scanner` inside a class body is a method,
and `setup_scanner` in `sensor.py` is just a function with an unlucky name. Both are
pinned in `tests/test_scanner.py`.

The four legacy entry points the rule looks for are not guessed. They are the exact
list core dispatches on in `homeassistant/components/device_tracker/legacy.py`:

```python
"async_get_scanner",
"get_scanner",
"async_setup_scanner",
"setup_scanner",
```

---

## Lovelace cards are covered too

On 2026-08-19 Home Assistant [deprecated parts of the device registry WebSocket
API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2026/08/19/device-registry-websocket-api-changes/).
The device fields `config_entries`, `config_entries_subentries` and
`primary_config_entry` are replaced by `config_entry_id` and
`config_subentry_id` (removed in Core 2027.8), and the command
`config/device_registry/remove_config_entry` is replaced by
`config/device_registry/remove` (removed in Core 2027.9). Nothing is broken
today, since core derives the old fields from the new ones until then. What
breaks on the deadline is not Python: it is the HACS **Lovelace cards** that
read device registry results over the WebSocket.

So the crawl now takes the HACS plugin category too, and matches `.js`, `.ts`
and `.mjs` source with anchored token rules: comments are stripped first, and a
rule only fires in a file that also references the WebSocket API (`callWS`,
`sendMessagePromise`, `subscribeDeviceRegistry`, or a `config/device_registry`
string). A card whose only mention of a field is in a doc comment produces
nothing.

**How skipped bundles are counted.** Many card repositories publish only a
compiled bundle. A `.min.js` file, or any file with a line over 5000
characters, is never matched. It is counted as `skipped_minified`, and
`node_modules`/vendored paths as `skipped_vendor`, per repository and in the
index's `coverage`. The board shows the total, so "0 findings" on a repo whose
only file was skipped reads as *not analysed*, never as clean. A TypeScript
card that ships both its source and its bundle is deduplicated to one finding
per rule, pointing at the source file.

On your own box the integration scans `www/community/**`, where HACS installs
cards, with the same rules, and raises the same Repairs issues with the card
name in the title. A card installed only as a minified bundle falls back to
the index's verdict on its source repository.

## Index format (schema 1)

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 1,
  "generated_utc": "2026-08-08T12:00:00Z",
  "core_version": "2026.10",
  "latest_release": "2026.8",
  "rc_release": "2026.9",
  "pending_floor": "2026.9",
  "pending_floor_source": "pypi",
  "coverage": { "catalog_total": 3088, "repos_scanned": 900, "repos_affected": 190, ... },
  "releases": { "2027.5": ["some_tracker"], "2027.8": ["another"] },
  "release_dates": { "2027.5": { "release_date": "2027-05-05", "days_until": 256 }, ... },
  "rules": [
    { "id": "legacy-device-tracker-platform", "breaks_in": "2027.5",
      "message": "...", "source": "https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/...",
      "confidence": "high", "matchable": true, "hits": 3, "repos_hit": 3,
      "match": { "type": "moduledef",
                 "names": ["async_get_scanner", "get_scanner",
                           "async_setup_scanner", "setup_scanner"],
                 "files": ["device_tracker.py"] } }
  ],
  "integrations": [
    { "full_name": "someone/some-tracker", "domain": "some_tracker",
      "version": "1.4.0", "stargazers_count": 42, "earliest_breaks_in": "2027.5",
      "release_date": "2027-05-05", "days_until": 256,
      "findings": [ { "rule_id": "...", "breaks_in": "2027.5",
                      "file": "...", "line": 12, "confidence": "high" } ] }
  ],
  "clean_domains": ["..."],
  "unreachable_domains": ["..."]
}
```

`integrations` lists only repositories **with** findings. `clean_domains` lists the ones
scanned and found clean, so a consumer can tell "no problems" from "not looked at yet".

An affected integration may also carry `upstream`, recording what its own
repository says: whether it is archived, whether it accepts issues, and the most
relevant existing report if there is one. That is what lets a notification say
"already reported, add a reaction there" instead of sending everybody to open
the same issue. It is optional, so an older index simply lacks it.

Every `matchable: true` rule ships its matcher as the nested `match` object — that is
what lets the integration run the same rules over locally installed code without the
index changing shape for it.

---

## Configuration

The Home Assistant integration has one setting, under **Settings → Devices &
Services → Breakage Radar → Configure**: how far ahead a deadline gets its own
notification (30, 60 or 90 days, 6 months, or a year). Everything outside that
window is listed in the summary instead.

For the crawler:

| Setting | Where | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Repos per run | `tools/scan.py --limit N` | `400` |
| Rescan everything | `tools/scan.py --force` | off |
| One repository | `tools/scan.py --only owner/repo` | — |
| Politeness pause | `tools/scan.py --sleep 0.25` | `0` |
| Downloads in flight | `tools/scan.py --workers 16` | `8` |
| Tag tarball cache | `tools/scan.py --tarball-cache DIR`, `--no-tarball-cache` | `.cache/tarballs` |
| Core branch | `tools/extract_rules.py --ref dev` | `dev` |
| Skip the blog crawl | `tools/blog_rules.py --no-network` | off |
| Force the catalogue fallback | `tools/catalog.py --force-fallback` | off |
| Working directory | `BREAKAGE_RADAR_ROOT` env var | the repo checkout |
| Check one local checkout | `tools/check_local.py <path>` | `.` |
| Check offline | `tools/check_local.py <path> --rules data/rules.json` | fetches the index |

Index URL and poll interval live in `custom_components/breakage_radar/const.py`
(`INDEX_URL`, `UPDATE_INTERVAL`) if you want to point the integration at your own crawl.

## Failure behaviour

Everything below is covered by a test.

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| Repository tag missing | falls back to `v`-tag, then `main`, then `master`; then `status: unreachable`, crawl continues |
| PyPI release lookup fails, or `--offline` | the last release it reported is reused, or dev minus one if none is remembered; the degradation is printed and the run continues |
| Repository has no `custom_components/` | recorded as scanned with zero findings |
| `SyntaxError` in third-party source | that file is skipped and counted; the run never aborts |
| GitHub returns 429 | exponential backoff (1 s, 2 s, 4 s), then the slice ends cleanly with state committed |
| Non-retryable HTTP status | one clear error line, no traceback |
| Corrupt tarball | `status: error` on that repo, crawl continues |
| Crawl interrupted | state and findings are checkpointed every 25 repositories |
| `index.json` unreachable from HA | the last good report is kept and the sensor goes **unavailable**; `last_error` says why |
| `index.json` is not schema 1 | rejected with a message rather than half-read |
| `custom_components/` missing or unreadable | empty report, no exception |
| An installed `manifest.json` is corrupt | the component still counts as installed, with an empty version |
| An installed integration's file will not parse or decode | counted in `unparsed_files`; the domain stays unknown with a reason, never falsely clean |
| An installed integration exceeds the local scan caps | counted in `skipped_files`; the index verdict is used if there is one |
| The local scan itself fails unexpectedly | logged, and the report falls back to index-only matching |
| The local scan is slow (many integrations, slow disk) | nothing waits for it: setup and refreshes return index results immediately, local results follow when the background scan finishes |
| Home Assistant is upgraded past a finding's deadline | the finding stays, reclassified `broken_now`, and Repairs escalates to ERROR |
| A release label cannot be turned into a date | no `imminent` opinion is formed; the finding is summarised rather than guessed at |
| The index ships no matchable rules | domains scan `unknown` with a reason — an empty rule set never reads as clean |
| The index ships a rule this installed engine is too old to run | the local scan reports which rule IDs it ran; any index finding it could not look for survives, attributed to the index. A local `clean` only speaks for the rules it actually ran |
| An integration directory is renamed or forked | matched by the domain its `manifest.json` declares, not the directory name |
| Very affected system | `details` caps at 100 entries and sets `details_truncated` |

---

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest              # offline; the whole suite
python -m pytest --run-network  # also hits codeload/GitHub for the live-core test
```

The extractor has a golden test against `tests/fixtures/core_mini.tar.gz` — five real
files copied verbatim out of home-assistant/core `dev`, with the archive's sha256
pinned in the test so the fixture cannot drift silently.

The Home Assistant integration is tested **without installing Home Assistant**:
`tests/conftest.py` registers minimal stand-ins for the handful of symbols the
integration imports, so `tests/test_integration.py` exercises the real shipped
`BreakageRadarSensor`, not a copy of its logic. If Home Assistant *is* installed, the
real package is used instead.

---

## Limitations

* **A finding is static analysis, not a guarantee.** `confidence: medium` rules match a
  method name on an object whose type is only known at runtime.
* **Index coverage is partial by design.** One slice is capped so the daily job stays
  inside GitHub's rate limits; `coverage.repos_scanned` always states how much of the
  4 009-repo catalogue has been visited so far. Since 1.1.0 this matters less on your
  own box: whatever the crawl has not reached, the integration scans locally with the
  same rules.
* **The local scan is bounded.** Per integration it reads at most 400 Python files of
  up to 1 MB each; anything beyond that is counted in `skipped_files` and the domain is
  reported unknown rather than clean.
* **The local scan parses with your box's own Python.** An installed file using syntax
  newer than your interpreter (for example PEP 695 `type` aliases on Python 3.11) is
  counted in `unparsed_files` and the domain falls back to the index verdict — the
  crawler parses with 3.14, so the index side never has this gap.
* **`attr_access_typed` infers types per scope, and errs towards silence.** It reports
  `DeviceEntry.config_entries` only where the receiver is proved in the scope that
  reads it, so a device entry built in another file, or handed over by a helper this
  file cannot see, is missed rather than guessed at. Measured on home-assistant/core: 51 of the 54 device-entry reads
  found, against 5 963 textual `.config_entries` occurrences, with no
  `hass.config_entries` among them. A missed
  call is a rule that stays quiet; a wrong one would waste a maintainer's afternoon,
  so the matcher is built to under-report.
* **A scoped `attr` rule resolves base classes one level, inside one file.** A class
  deriving from `StateVacuumEntity` is matched whether it names the base directly, under
  an import alias, dotted as `vacuum.StateVacuumEntity`, among several bases, or through
  an intermediate class defined in the same file. A chain that leaves the file
  (`from .base import BaseVacuum`) is not followed, because nothing in the file proves
  what `.base` derives from. Undercounting, again on purpose.
* **`imminent` is computed from the release schedule, `broken_now` is not.** The
  first-Wednesday rule is Home Assistant's published schedule and has been exact all
  year, but it is applied locally, not fetched — a release moved for a one-off reason
  would shift the window by a few days. Whether a deadline has already *passed* is
  decided by version comparison alone, so that half can never be wrong.
* **Card matching is text-level, not parsed.** The `js` rules anchor on the
  deprecated token, strip comments first, and require the file to reference the
  WebSocket API, but there is no JavaScript parser behind them. A minified
  bundle is never guessed at: it is skipped and counted instead.
* **Themes and AppDaemon apps are out of scope.** Integrations and Lovelace
  plugins are covered; the other HACS categories are not.
* **No automatic fixing.** v1 tells you what breaks and when; it does not rewrite code.

## Prior art

[`custom-components/breaking_changes`](https://github.com/custom-components/breaking_changes)
did something adjacent and was archived on 2022-05-28, its own README noting *"At the
time of archiving the integration has not worked in over a year."* It compared installed
components against *published* breaking changes — after the fact. Breakage Radar looks at
removals that have **not happened yet**, from a static analysis of the integration's own
source, so there is time to act.

Spook is the tool people most often expect to cover this; it does not, for the reasons
in [How this differs from Spook, and from reading the log](#how-this-differs-from-spook-and-from-reading-the-log).

---

## Changelog

Every release is documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), including what each fix
actually changed about the verdict you see. Releases are tagged on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/releases).

---

## Are you the author of a flagged integration?

Read **[guides/for-integration-authors.md](guides/for-integration-authors.md)** — what a
listing claims (and what it does not), how to check your own checkout before you
release, how a listing clears itself once you ship a fix, and how to report a finding
you think is wrong.

The self-check runs against any checkout, including forks and private integrations the
daily crawl can never see:

```bash
python tools/check_local.py /path/to/your-integration
```

It exits `0` clean, `1` with findings, `2` if it could not check — so it works as a
release gate in your own CI. A checkout with `custom_components/` is read as an
integration, one without is read as a Lovelace card repository; you do not have to say
which.

The same scan runs as a GitHub Action, which is the only way this project reaches the
person who can actually fix a finding:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v7
- uses: Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar@v1.10.0
```

It annotates the exact line and writes a job summary, and by default it does **not**
fail the job — a removal scheduled for 2027.8 turning an unrelated pull request red is
how a check gets deleted from a workflow file. `fail-on: imminent` gates on what is
close; `fail-on: any` is the strict gate. Inputs are documented in
[the authors' guide](guides/for-integration-authors.md#in-your-ci-as-a-github-action).

---

## Questions, findings and false positives

* **[Discussions](https://github.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/discussions)** —
  questions, "is this finding right?", and anything you would rather not file as a bug.
* **[Issues](https://github.com/Booyaka101/hass-breakage-radar/issues)** — false
  positives and false negatives especially. A finding names the exact file and line, so
  a report that quotes them is immediately actionable, and a wrong rule is worth fixing
  fast: it is a tax on every user it fires on.

---

## Contributing a rule

Add it to `data/manual_rules.json` with a `source` URL that states the removal release,
then run `python tools/blog_rules.py && python tools/scan.py --limit 50 --force` and
check the hit rate in `python tools/build_index.py` output. A rule that fires on a large
fraction of the catalogue is a tax, not a signal — tighten it or ship it as
`matchable: false`.
