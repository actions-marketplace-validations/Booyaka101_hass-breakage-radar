"""Release-label date arithmetic, shared by the crawler and the integration.

This file exists twice, byte for byte: ``tools/schedule.py`` and
``custom_components/breakage_radar/schedule.py``, the same arrangement as
``rules_engine.py`` and guarded by the same kind of test. The integration has
to ship self-contained (``"requirements": []``) and ``tools/`` has to run
without the integration installed, so the module is vendored rather than
imported across the boundary.
