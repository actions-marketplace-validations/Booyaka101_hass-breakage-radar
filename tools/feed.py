"""Publishes the announced removals as an RSS feed.

Asked for on the announcement thread: "Can I have an RSS feed? I don't want to
crawl." The index is a snapshot, so following it means diffing it yourself.
The feed answers the other question, which is what is *new*, and it costs
nothing to host because the crawl already publishes static files.

One item per Home Assistant release, carrying that release's own content: what
it removes, and which HACS integrations still use it. A release is the unit
people follow, and it gives a reader something to read in place.

An item is news when a rule joins the release. The integration count moves
every day as the crawl widens, and dating the item on that would re-notify
every subscriber daily, so ``pubDate`` is the newest first-seen date among the
release's rules. Those dates live in ``state/feed.json``, keyed by rule,
because a rule carries the release it breaks in and not the day it was
announced.
