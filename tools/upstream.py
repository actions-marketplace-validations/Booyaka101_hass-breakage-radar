"""Looks up what an integration's own repository already says about a finding.

A user told "this breaks" needs to know whether it is already reported before
doing anything. Asking every user's Home Assistant to search GitHub would need
a token from each of them and would hit the 30 requests per minute search
limit immediately, so the crawler does it once and publishes the answer.

Only reports that look like they are about the deprecation are returned. A
search for the symbol also matches tracebacks pasted into unrelated bug
reports, and linking someone to "Bug: everything is unavailable" as though it
were the report would be worse than saying nothing.
