"""Extract breakage rules straight out of the Home Assistant core source tree.

Downloads ``https://codeload.github.com/home-assistant/core/tar.gz/refs/heads/dev``,
AST-walks every ``homeassistant/**/*.py`` *inside the tarball* (nothing is
extracted to disk) and collects every call that passes a **string literal** to
``breaks_in_ha_version``.

The ground truth for the signature is ``homeassistant/helpers/frame.py``::

    def report_usage(

    ) -> None:

``custom_integration_behavior`` defaults to ``LOG`` -- a custom integration that
trips one of these gets a line in ``home-assistant.log`` and nothing else. That
is precisely why this project exists.
