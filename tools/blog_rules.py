"""Merge prose-only deprecations into the rule set.

Home Assistant announces plenty of removals that never appear as a
``report_usage(..., breaks_in_ha_version=...)`` call in core -- the legacy
device tracker platform API being the flagship example. Two sources cover them:

1. **The developer blog index** (https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/).
   Every post is scanned for sentences naming a Core release, e.g. *"will be
   removed in the Home Assistant 2027.5 release"*. These become **informational**
   rules: they appear on the board so a user can see the deadline, but they carry
   no matcher and never claim a repository is affected.

2. **``data/manual_rules.json``** -- hand-curated rules with real matchers, each
   traceable to one of those posts. This is where the machine-checkable version
   of a prose deprecation lives, because turning English into an AST matcher is
   a judgement call that must not be automated (see README, "How rules are
   chosen").

Reads ``data/rules.json`` (from ``tools/extract_rules.py``) and rewrites it with
the blog and manual rules merged in.

Usage::

    python tools/blog_rules.py [--rules data/rules.json] [--no-network]
